# IOT-assisted-Health-Monitoring-using-Machine-Learning
The project deals with real-time health monitoring system using various sensors. We will also be detecting the health status of an individual in three levels using ML model. Level 0 will indicate health status as Healthy, Level 1 will indicate a little decline while Level 2 will show the person with poor health.
